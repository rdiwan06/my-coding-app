Welcome! In this module, you'll **build your own text-based adventure game**.
Follow the instructions, write your code in the window below, and use hints if you get stuck.
You'll combine **input/output, if/else statements, for loops, and while loops** to create your game.

st.markdown("""
1. Use `input()` to get choices from the player.
2. Use `print()` to describe scenes and outcomes.
3. Use `if/elif/else` to handle decisions.
4. Use `for` loops for repeating actions like collecting items.
5. Use `while` loops for challenges until the player succeeds.
6. Start small and build your game step by step.
7. Use the **Show Hint** button if you get stuck (10 hints are available).

### Tips:
- Replace placeholders or blanks in your code with actual logic.
- Start with small sections and test frequently.
- Use hints to guide you but try to code as much as you can yourself.
- Have fun and be creative with your adventure story!
